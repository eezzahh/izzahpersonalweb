    <p>Work at KFC</p>

<div align="center" style=" letter-spacing: 3px;">
    <p><b> On 11 May 2021,</b> Because I donâ€™t have anything to do during the semester break, my friend and I decide to work at KFC as 'Contract Raya' for 10 days. It was my first job of my life. I was assigned to work in the kitchen division or we called it as 'backup' where we responsible in frying fries, making burger, cooking rice and many more. On my first day, I got culture shock for a while, because it is not an easy work and it is so so so tiring. My experience working at KFC was not so great. I only work there for 8 days only because I cant hold the environment. But at least, I learned something new there :) </p>
